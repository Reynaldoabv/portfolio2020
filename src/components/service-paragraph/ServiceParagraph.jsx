            You need a partner who knows the tools inside and out. I have coded multiple projects with a variety of the latest 
            technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap 3 o 4, ReactStrap, React JS, Express, MongoDB, 
            Node JS, GraphQL (Apollo-Client) to create one of kind webapp. <br/><br/>

            If you can imagine it, We can build it. And since there are more mobile phones than people on Earth, I'll help you 
            to make fully responsive websites to ensure a good looking site across all screen sizes.<br/><br/>

            {/* Great responsive design means blending beautiful aesthetics with smart functionality, and making sure everything looks 
            great on every screen. I always put the usersâ€™ needs and behaviours first to provide a great user experience. 
            No matter what the size or scope, I craft feature and user-friendly solutions that help my clients get the results 
            they want.<br/><br/> */}

            Working on interesting projects with nice people is definitely something I do love but more importantly, I want your 
            project to succeed and with me at your side, that's exactly what we will achieve.<br/><br/>
