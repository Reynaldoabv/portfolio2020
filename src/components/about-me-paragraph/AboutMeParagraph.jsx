            Since the beginning of my journey as a Front-End Developer, I knew I was hook into the world of 
            Software Development. <br/><br/>
            I understood this would not be "just a job" for me but, an engaging challenge to continually learn 
            and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. <br/><br/>
            What started with checking a simple course has become a full-fledged passion that allows me to develop 
            successful websites with both creativity and utility. <br/><br/>
            My goal is always to build products that provide great UI and performant experiences.
